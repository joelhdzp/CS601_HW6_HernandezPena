# CS601 - Assignment 6: Inventory App (Update)

## üìÑ Project Description

**Fresh Eats** - Inventory App is a React-based web application for managing and viewing grocery store inventory. Users can view the main inventory list, click any item to see detailed product info (including images and descriptions), and access a help tab for support. The application is fully responsive, user-friendly, and features clean, organized code with meaningful comments. It is an extension and enhancement of the Assignment 5 inventory app, adding product detail pages, responsive design, a help/search tab, and improved navigation using React Router v6. The app is client-side and uses React + Vite for fast performance and scalability.

## üí´ Highlights

### App.jsx

- Main layout, includes header, menu, and footer.
- Uses `<Routes>` to swap between:
  - `InventoryList` (`/`)
  - `ProductTab` (`/product`)
  - `ProductDetail` (`/product/:sku`)
  - `HelpTab` (`/help`)
- All page transitions are handled by React Router.

### InventoryList.jsx

- Fetches all inventory data from `/public/inventory.json`.
- Maps through items and wraps each in a `<Link>` so the whole item is clickable.
- Key: Passes SKU, name, qty, and price as props to `InventoryItem`.

### ProductDetail.jsx

- Uses React Router‚Äôs `useParams()` to extract the SKU from the URL.
- Fetches product data and filters for the selected item.
- Displays product image, description, and all info.
- Includes a Home button to navigate back.

### Menu.jsx

- Uses `<NavLink>` for active styling and highlights.
- Renders Product as a non-link on product detail pages to prevent unnecessary navigation.
- Responsive: adapts to small screens, shows hamburger menu icon.

### HelpTab.jsx

- Renders an input and search button.
- On search, simulates a loading state for 1 second with a wait cursor.

### App.css

- Responsive grid layout for inventory.
- Detailed styles for header, menu, items, footer, product detail.
- Pseudo-classes and media queries ensure good usability and aesthetics on any device.
- Menu and items show visual cues on hover or when active.
